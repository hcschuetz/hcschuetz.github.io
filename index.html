  <h1>Code and Demos by Heribert Schütz</h1>

  <h2>TodoMVC with MobX, Custom Elements and JSX</h2>

  <a href="./todomvc-mobx-jsx/dist/">Demo</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/hcschuetz/todomvc-mobx-jsx">Source</a>

  <p>
    In this project I have explored an approach for building web applications
    based on a reactive state
    (provided by <em>MobX</em> and <em><code>mobx-keystone</code></em>).
    The idea was that the reactive state can be mapped to a UI dynamically
    so that a powerful framework such as React is no more needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    I do, however, use a light-weight home-grown <em>JSX</em> implementation,
    which makes the application code succinct and readable.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Custom elements</em>
    (one of the technologies for Web Components, supported directly by browsers)
    help to structure the application.
  </p>
  <p>
    The experiment was actually quite successful.
    The approach should be suitable for projects that require
    (or benefit from) reactive state management anyway.
  </p>

  <h2>Performance study based on the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT)</h2>

  <a href="./fft/build/">Demo</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/hcschuetz/fft">Source</a>

  <p>
    With this project I investigated high-performance-computing capabilities
    of the Web platform.
    The Fast Fourier Transformation was chosen as a number-crunching example
    with non-trivial complexity,
    but which is still simple enough to implement various versions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The FFT implementations vary in several aspects:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>home-grown and third-party implementations</li>
    <li>from very naive to quite refined algorithms</li>
    <li>programming languages:
      TypeScript, C++, Rust, and even a small home-grown language
    </li>
    <li>Runtime technologies:
      JavaScript, Web Assembly (WASM), native code (not in the browser demo)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The FFT demo includes two application demos, which are more entertaining:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="fft/build/#ClockworkDemo">One demo</a>
      uses FFT to create moving graphical output
      (using SVG or the <code>Canvas</code> API)
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="fft/build#AudioDemo">The other demo</a>
      uses FFT to analyze sound input captured with the Web Audio API.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Guitar Simulation</h2>
  
  <a href="guitar-simulation/">Demo</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/hcschuetz/guitar-simulation">Source</a>

  <p>
    While the audio demo in the FFT project analyzes <em>incoming audio</em>,
    this project uses the Web Audio API to synthesize <em>outgoing audio</em>.
